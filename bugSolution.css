To fix the issue, ensure that you include spaces around the operators within the `calc()` function and use consistent units throughout the calculation.  Always double-check your units and operator precedence to avoid potential errors.

```css
/* Corrected CSS */
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

.element {
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
  /* Correct spacing around operators */
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

It is important to prioritize clear, consistent, and well-spaced `calc()` expressions to avoid unexpected rendering issues.
