The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results can occur due to operator precedence or unit inconsistencies. For instance, using `calc(100% - 50px)` might not work as expected if the parent container's width is not explicitly set.  Another potential issue is forgetting to use spaces around the operators in a calculation, causing unexpected parsing behavior. For example, `calc(100%-50px)` is incorrect while `calc(100% - 50px)` is correct.
